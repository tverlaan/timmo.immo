Hi! My name is Timmo Verlaan and this is my website. I live in Amsterdam together with my wife Brechje and our three kids, Nore, Tuur & Roeks.

I'm working as a software developer with quite some experience in Voice over IP. I've written code in multiple lanugages, currently [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) stands out the most. I like it so much that it helped me to brew beer [which I talked about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMHXd_iMGRU) at [Elixir Conf EU 2017](http://www.archive.elixirconf.eu/elixirconf2017). Giving that talk inspired me to present more often, here are a few more:

  * "A war story - from failures to success" at [Code BEAM STO 2020](https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/)
  * [No(de) Discovery without DNS & EPMD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_YUyd_Qdjs) at [Code BEAM STO 2018](https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto-2018/)

As you might have guessed I also like to do other things than writing software like drinking and brewing beer & coffee, going on adventures and making jokes, good and bad ones. You're not obligated to laugh, I will, to make up for it.
