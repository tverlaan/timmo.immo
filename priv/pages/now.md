## Job 📦

I'm working as a Lead Software Developer at [Wuunder](wearewuunder.com). Growing and improving our logistics platform and expanding to multiple countries in Europe.

## Recently moved 🏡

Me and my family recently moved and are doing a lot of work ourselves. This definitely puts a strain on other things, but it's so much worth it. Next up is the bathroom.

## Reading 📖

I am still reading [Scaling Up](https://scalingup.com) by Verne Harnish and I started reading The Circle. I've seen the movie, but a book brings a different kind of perspective on things.

## Van conversion 🚌

The van is currently on hold due to our house move. We're still excited to continue with it ASAP. Progress can be followed on the photo sharing website.
