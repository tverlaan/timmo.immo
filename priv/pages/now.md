## Job 📶

I quit employment and I'm currently working as contractor for Athonet.

## Recently moved 🏡

We moved about a year ago and are doing a lot of work ourselves. This definitely puts a strain on other things, but it's so much worth it. We remodeled and expanded the bath room. Next up are the solar panels!

## Reading 📖

I haven't got much time for reading between work, kids and renovating the house. I'm open to book suggestions though.

## Van conversion 🚌

The summer of 2021 was the first time we went on a trip with our van. It's still very much a work in progress, but at least usable 😄. Progress can be followed on the photo sharing website.
