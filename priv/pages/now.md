## Job ðŸ“¦

I'm working as a Lead Software Developer at [Wuunder](wearewuunder.com). Growing and improving our logistics platform and expanding to multiple countries in Europe.

## Reading ðŸ“–

I just started reading [Scaling Up](https://scalingup.com) by Verne Harnish. I haven't decided on my next fictional book yet.

I just finished [Humankind: A Hopeful History / De Meeste Mensen Deugen](https://decorrespondent.nl/demeestemensendeugen) by Rutger Bregman. I can recommend this one if you're looking for a positive perspective on the human species and the world. I also re-read a book I read probably ~20 years ago; [The World of Null A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_of_Null-A) by A. E. van Vogt. If you're into SciFi check it out :).

## Van conversion ðŸšŒ

We're getting closer to a point in which the van will look finished. The roof goes up in a few weeks. We also did quite some work on the kitchen and some cabin space. Progress can be followed on the photo sharing website.
